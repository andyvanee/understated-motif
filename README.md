# Understated Motif

A collection of background patterns, harvested from:

- <http://subtlepatterns.com>
- <http://www.squidfingers.com/patterns>
- <http://www.backgroundlabs.com/backgrounds>
- <http://www.kollermedia.at/pattern4u>

The patterns have been processed to be semi-transparent png's so you can
preview them with a background color of your choosing.

To rebuild with new patterns, place your images at
subtle-patterns/whatever/*.png and run `make`. Rebuilding requires
